# CS 1440 Assignment 5.0: Refactoring - Understanding Fractals

This program is intentionally difficult to understand for two reasons:

0.  The code is messy
1.  Fractals are an esoteric subject

Your goal in this sprint is to merely clean up the code.  You do not need to
grasp the big picture to know which lines of code are poorly written.  Nor do
you actually need to understand how fractals work to do this.  You can clean up
*any* program through trial-and-error if you work slowly and carefully:

0.  Make small changes
1.  Focused on only one part of the program at a time
2.  Re-run the program often
3.  Commit code to Git frequently
    *   If your test didn't work, revert the changes instead


Some students can't handle taking a leap of faith and desire a deeper
understanding of fractals.  If this is you, I hope this document helps.


## Understanding the fractal algorithms

*   Our program uses the [Escape-Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plotting_algorithms_for_the_Mandelbrot_set) plotting algorithm
*   The points *inside* the cardioid are the Mandelbrot set
    *   The escape-time algorithm gets stuck in an infinite loop for points within the Mandelbrot set
    *   Capping the number of iterations prevents the program from hanging
*   An image of the Mandelbrot set produced by this program is a visualization
    of the complex plane, formed by relating complex numbers to Cartesian
    coordinates:
    *   The coordinates of pixels in the `PhotoImage` object are pairs of X, Y
        coordinates.  The origin of the `PhotoImage` object `(0, 0)` is the
        upper-left corner of the image window.
    *   Complex numbers are ordered pairs of Real and Imaginary components.
    *   The `X` axis of the Mandelbrot set represents the *real* number line.
    *   The `Y` axis of the Mandelbrot set represents the *imaginary* number
        line.
    *   The function that draws the image (`paint()` in `src/mbrot_fractal.py` and
        `makePictureOfFractal()` in `src/phoenix_fractal.py`) converts the `(X,
        Y)` coordinates of the `PhotoImage` into a complex number.  This
        complex number is called `C` in the Mandelbrot algorithm and `Z` in the
        Phoenix algorithm.
    *   The image drawing function chooses the color to paint a pixel by
        counting the number of times the fractal function can be *iterated*
        before its output exceeds a threshold.
    *   *Iteration* in this context means to use the output of a function as
        its input value again and again to find out if the function tends
        toward infinity.
*   The Mandelbrot function is fascinating because *sometimes* iteration makes
    it go off to infinity and *sometimes* it does not.
    *   The points *inside* the cardioid are the points *within* the Mandelbrot
        set.  These are the coordinates on the imaginary plane corresponding to
        `Z` values that stay small after repeated iterations of the Mandelbrot
        function.
    *   Points *outside* of the cardioid shoot off to infinity under iteration.
    *   Points at the boundary are where all of the pretty and interesting
        pictures occur.
*   Study and experiment with the [Interactive Mandelbrot Viewer Demo](../demo/interactive.py).
    While it isn't much prettier than the starter code, it can help you grasp
    how the algorithm works.


### More fractal resources

You can find ideas for new fractal configurations by exploring the Mandelbrot and Phoenix sets online.  You can also compare your program's output with other Mandelbrot and Phoenix set visualizers to make sure that you haven't made any serious mistakes.  You will find that some fractal viewers draw Phoenix fractals that are rotated 90Â° relative to ours.  This is a result of our formula "reflecting" the `Z` parameter.

#### Online Fractal Zoomers

Most of these websites define their images in `(minX, minY), (maxX, maxY)` coordinates, while our program uses the `(centerX, centerY) + axisLength` scheme.  It is helpful to write a small helper program which converts between the coordinate formats.
